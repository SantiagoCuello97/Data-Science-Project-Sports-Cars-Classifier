# Sports Cars Classifier

Data science project example using deep learning for image classification.

## Overview
This project is based on [Ken jee](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers)'s youtube video where he explains how to make a project that leverages deep learning for image classification. In his project he built a ball classifier to identify balls from different sports, in which he was able to get the model to predict the sport of the ball with 94% accuracy after minimal tuning. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy-R4oUZaC8&t=1142s&ab_channel=KenJee) is the link to the video.

My idea was to replicate the project to learn and apply the basics of deep learning and use a different data set to see how well the model can be trained using more complex objets (sports cars in this case).  After using transfer learning on a CNN trained on resnet34, I was able to get the model to predict the brand of the car with 94% accuracy too.
